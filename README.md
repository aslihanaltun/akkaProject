Basic App with AKKA Framework

This repository contains a simple Java application developed using the AKKA framework. The application consists of two actors in a small system. One actor will send a message "Hi from Actor1" to the other actor, and the second actor will respond with "Hi from Actor2". The communication between the actors will happen over two separate ports.

Note:
This is a basic example to demonstrate the AKKA framework's usage for simple message passing between actors.
For more complex applications, consider exploring the AKKA documentation and tutorials.
